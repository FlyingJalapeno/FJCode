// SMModelObject is a very handy superclass for "Model Object" types.
// It requires the 64-bit runtime, either iOS >4.0 or Snow Leopard, and LLVM Clang >=1.6.

// Additionally, as of this writing, you'll need to add the compiler flags "-Xclang -fobjc-nonfragile-abi2" in that exact
// order if you don't want to have to write @synthesize yourself. This shouldn't be necessary after the official Clang 2.0 release. More info about that here:
// http://www.mcubedsw.com/blog/index.php/site/comments/new_objective-c_features/

// Much, much credit given to Andr√© Pang and his phenomenal RMModelObject which was the inspiration for this class.
