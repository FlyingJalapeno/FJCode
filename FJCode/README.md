ATMHud - Library for the creation of HUDs in iPhone applications
================================================================
I once needed a HUD for one of my iPhone apps, but was unhappy with the currently available libraries on the internet. Therefore, I decided to create my own library. I've released it as a static library last year, but a lot of people wanted to see the source, so here it is.
