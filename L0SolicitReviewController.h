 If a string with a URL is in the application's Info.plist at this key,
 new L0SolicitReviewControllers will have their applicationAppStoreURL
 property set to that URL.
 
 This is the URL where the user will be sent to review an app. This is
 -- CURRENTLY, as of iPhone OS 2.2 -- an URL of the form:
 http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewContentsUserReviews?id=12233445&pageNumber=0&sortOrdering=1&type=Purple+Software
 where 12233445 is the application identifier on the store. This is not
 available before release, so you can point this to a URL on your web site
 for the initial release and set it to the correct Store URL with an update.
 
 This is the same link as the "show all %d reviews" link in the application page
 on the Store.

 This notification is sent some time after you call -solicit, -showAlertIfNeeded
 or -showAlert to warn you that user interaction has ended. When you receive
 this notification, you can safely release the controller.

/*
 This controller solicits a user to review an application at the App Store
 after a certain time has passed. Currently, this class will solicit a
 review if the application was launched five or more times and a week
 has passed since the first launch.
 
 It should be enough to have:
	[L0SolicitReviewController solicit];
 in applicationDidFinishLaunching: for this to work.
 
 You can fine-tune this class by changing its properties, preventing it from changing
 the application's defaults and controlling the soliciting alert yourself by
 changing its properties. You can construct an instance of this class with
 alloc/init as usual, or get a default instance with the +defaultController
 method.

 disable this behavior by changing this property to NO. Defaults to YES.
 
 Note that if you disable this, you will be responsible for setting the
 .firstLaunchDate, .numberOfLaunches and .didSolicitAlready properties to
 reasonable values; the +solicit method will *NOT* work in this case, as
 it relies on reading information from defaults. You'll have to call
 the -solicit method instead after changing the defaults.
